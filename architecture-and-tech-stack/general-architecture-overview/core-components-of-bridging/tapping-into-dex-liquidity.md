# üè¶ Tapping Into DEX Liquidity

With InfinitySwap protocols, we integrate our Bridge Pool through 1Inche or other applicable aggregators where applicable. If no aggregators exist then we tap directly into the router to gather quotes and conduct cross-chain swaps.

In the absence of a DEX on a network, the standard two-way liquidity pool protocols come into play.
