| Lock and Mint and Burn and Mint Bridges violate the principle of single responsibility introducing increased risk to each mapped token.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The impact areas include the significant value of assets locked in bridge pools along with the exploit of the protocol itself with itâ€™s ability to mint a limitless amount of tokens.                         | high         | <p>Secure bridging architecture should include the following technical and business process security measures.</p><ol><li>Bridge scop should be limited to transfer and keeping track of the state of assets across networks. It should not have any interactive or operative control over the token contract</li><li>Bridge pool asset lock up should be decentralized and diverted to multi-sig safes owned by each project rather than the bridge protocol</li></ol> |
| UX - Using a multi-chain or cross-chain token bridge is a still a foreign concept to most community members. Current UX doesnâ€™t prioritize guidance through the bridging process. A step by step walk through shall guide the user through the bridging process.                                                                          | Many new users are weary of using bridges and resort to centralized exchanges or are stuck with tokens on one network. This hinders the ability of new layer 1 / 2 networks to drive TVL towards their chain. | medium       | The UX of the bridging protocol must be geared towards novice users with step by step guidance. The UX should enable novice users to bridge assets without having to read a help article or watch a help video. However, it should not frustrate advanced users. Finding the balance in this UX implementation is key.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Unauthorized Wrapped Assets - Many projects have shared concerns over segregated and unauthorized liquidity along with faux markets being created for their token on networks where the project is not providing official support. This also introduces an increased risk of scams and unauthorized raises increasing the chance of rugs. | Many users take part in faux markets created by bad actors launching wrapped tokens on unvetted bridges and then creating a faux market on DEXs.                                                              | HIGH         | Bridge deployment instructions and guidance must provide steps to inform the community of the official project tokesn on origin and destination networks. Guidance should be shared with the community to avoid and limit the potential of scams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
